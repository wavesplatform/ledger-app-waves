# Ledgered

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/LedgerHQ/ledgered/graph/badge.svg?token=0mwgQwrusz)](https://codecov.io/gh/LedgerHQ/ledgered)
[![CodeQL](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgered/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgered/actions/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml)

This repository aims at regrouping three other somehow similar yet different repositories / libraries:

- [LedgerComm](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgercomm)
- [Ledgerblue](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/blue-loader-python) and
- [Ledgerctl](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgerctl) (also found as LedgerWallet)


It will also contain libraries, utilitaries and other snippets useful when interfacing with Ledger
devices (NanoS, S+, X and Stax).
